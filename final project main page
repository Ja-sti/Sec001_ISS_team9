<h1>The Environmental and Economic Effects of Pollution Restrictions From Wealthier Nations</h1>
<p>Many wealthier nations have begun to create restrictions on pollution now that the environment is becoming more and more threatened by what our industrial society does, and they also impose these restrictions on the poorer nations who haven't had a chance to make full use of the industrialization yet.
The fact that the wealthier nations set the rules such that these poorer nations have to do the same amount of conservation as th wealthier nation, further divides the world
between rich and poor because it costs the poorer nations more than they can afford, and it robs them of the oppurtunity to grow in the same way the wealthier nations did</p>
